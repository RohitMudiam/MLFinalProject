## Short Description about Project 
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Gathering extensive medical information is crucial, even though not all of it is directly useful. Expert knowledge or experience with heart failure symptoms is essential for early detection. Medical datasets are often diverse and dispersed, but data mining is a powerful tool for extracting predictive and actionable information from large databases. This project improves heart disease prediction by employing the entropy feature selection technique and eliminating unnecessary features through various classification methods. The project evaluates the performance of these techniques using metrics such as F1-score, recall, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision. The main objective is to determine the most effective classifier for heart disease detection.
